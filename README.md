The project is designed to predict future sales based on historical data. Here's how you can use the forecasting model:

Prepare the Data: Load your dataset (typically in CSV or Excel format) containing historical sales data.
Train the Model: The project uses machine learning models (Prophet) to train the data.
Forecast Sales: After training, the model will predict future sales for the next few months/weeks.
